# Fake Profile Detection with Random Forest and Bayesian Hyperparameter Tuning in Python

## Description
This repository hosts Python code for a machine learning workflow aimed at detecting fake profiles using Random Forest. It encompasses the loading and preprocessing of data, exploration of different models, and the optimization of hyperparameters through Bayesian optimization with Optuna. 

The primary goal is to construct a sophisticated classifier capable of accurately identifying fake profiles based on provided data.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project originates from Kaggle, under the title "Instagram: Detecting Fake Accounts". This dataset includes essential features for distinguishing fake profiles on Instagram. To access the data, users have two options:

1. Download directly from Kaggle.
