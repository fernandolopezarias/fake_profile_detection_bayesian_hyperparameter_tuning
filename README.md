# Fake Profile Detection with Logistic Regression and Hyperparameter Tuning in Python

## Description
This repository hosts Python code for a machine learning workflow aimed at detecting fake profiles using logistic regression. It encompasses the loading and preprocessing of data, cross-validation, and the optimization of hyperparameters through Bayesian optimization with Optuna. The primary goal is to construct a sophisticated classifier capable of accurately identifying fake profiles based on provided data.

## Data Source
The dataset used for this project originates from Kaggle, under the title "Instagram: Detecting Fake Accounts". This dataset includes essential features for distinguishing fake profiles on Instagram. To access the data, users have two options:
1. Download directly from Kaggle.
2. Access a ready-to-use version from this repository (provide location/link within your repository where the data is hosted, if applicable).

## Steps Included in the Code
1. Load the Data: Initiate the process by loading the dataset into the code.
2. Preprocess the Data: Perform feature preprocessing for optimal model training.
3. Define the Logistic Regression Model: The model is defined within the scope of the hyperparameter tuning process using Optuna.
4. Perform Cross-Validation and Hyperparameter Tuning Using Optuna: Apply Optuna for rigorous model tuning.
5. Output the Best Hyperparameters: Display the most effective parameters identified.
6. Train the Model with the Best Parameters Found: Proceed to train the logistic regression model with these parameters.
7. Predictions and Performance Evaluation: Evaluate the model's accuracy and efficiency on test data.
8. Show Feature Importance: Analyze and interpret the significance of different features based on the model coefficients.
