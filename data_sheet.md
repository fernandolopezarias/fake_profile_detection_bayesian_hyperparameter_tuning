# Datasheet

## Motivation
Purpose of Dataset Creation: This dataset was created for the purpose of developing a model to detect fake profiles on Instagram, a popular social media platform.
Dataset Creators and Funding: The specific creator(s) is found in this publicly available Kaggle site https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jasvindernotra/instagram-detecting-fake-accounts, this is of free access and unknown funding if any.

## Composition
Dataset Instances: The dataset consists of Instagram user profiles. Each instance represents a user profile with features like profile picture presence, username length, number of followers, and whether the account is private.
Number of Instances: The dataset contains 576 instances.
Missing Data: All columns have 576 non-null entries, indicating no missing data in this dataset.
Confidentiality: The dataset appears to be anonymized with no direct personal identifiers.

## Collection Process
Data Acquisition: The dataset was likely collected from Instagram profiles, but the specific method of collection is not mentioned.
Sampling Strategy: There is no information about the sampling strategy.
Time Frame: The time frame of data collection is not specified.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labelling
Preprocessing Steps: The dataset seems to have undergone preprocessing as it contains numerical and categorical features ready for analysis. Details of preprocessing steps are not provided.
Raw Data Preservation: It's unclear if the raw data was preserved alongside this processed data.
Uses
Potential Uses: Beyond detecting fake profiles, this dataset could be used for social media behavior analysis, studying the characteristics of active versus inactive or spam accounts.
Composition and Collection Impact: The lack of diversity in the dataset (limited to Instagram and a small sample size) might limit its generalizability. Users should be cautious of potential biases.
Inadvisable Uses: The dataset should not be used for purposes that invade user privacy or for making assumptions about individual behavior beyond the scope of fake profile detection.

## Distribution
Distribution Details: The distribution method of this dataset is not mentioned in the notebook or the dataset.
Copyright and IP License: There is no information regarding copyright or intellectual property licenses associated with this dataset.
## Maintenance
Dataset Maintenance: The maintainer of the dataset is not identified.
